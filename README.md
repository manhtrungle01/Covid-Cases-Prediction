# Covid-Cases-Prediction
The Notebook aims to conduct Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to predict Covid cases of a anonymised country.

This work was done under an educational setting designed as an accuracy competition. Specifically, the test dataset was not publicised to compare the accuracy between participants.Therefore, the final test statistic in the main file is solely for code checking purpose and does not convey meaningful performance. Eventually, this work was ranked on second tier in terms of accuracy.
